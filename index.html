    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question"> 1) Is it safe to use Virtual Mobile Number?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Using a virtual mobile number can enhance privacy by allowing you to share a different number for online transactions or registrations, helping to avoid spam. However, its safety largely depends on the service provider; reputable providers typically have strong security measures in place. Be cautious of potential vulnerabilities, such as SIM swapping and phishing attacks. While virtual numbers can be useful, especially for temporary needs, it's essential to choose a trustworthy provider and consider any legal implications, particularly for business use.</p>

        <button class="faq-question"> 2) Do I need to keep the app running in background to receive calls? </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes, to receive calls on a virtual mobile number app, you generally need to keep the app running in the background. Most virtual number services require the app to be open or active to receive incoming calls. If the app is closed or not running, you may miss calls or notifications. Some services may offer options to forward calls to another number, allowing you to receive calls without the app open, but this depends on the specific features of the service you are using.</p>

        <button class="faq-question"> 3) Can I use this number for 2 step authentications via sms?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes, you can use a virtual mobile number for two-step authentication (2FA) via SMS, provided that the service you are using accepts virtual numbers. Many online platforms allow the use of virtual numbers for 2FA, making it a convenient option for enhancing security. However, be aware that some services may block virtual numbers or have restrictions, so it's a good idea to verify compatibility before relying on a virtual number for authentication.</p>

        <button class="faq-question"> 4) How much time does it takes for sms to be delivered to my email?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The time it takes for an SMS to be delivered to your email can vary depending on several factors. Different virtual number services have varying processing speeds; some may deliver SMS almost instantly, while others might take a few minutes. Network conditions can also impact delivery times, as delays or issues within the network may slow down the process. Additionally, the email provider can play a role; some providers may experience delays in processing incoming emails. Typically, most services aim for near-instant delivery, often within seconds to a few minutes. If you encounter significant delays, it’s advisable to check with the service provider for any potential issues.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">5) Is there an option to change my email for receiving voicemails?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes, most virtual number services offer the option to change the email address where you receive voicemails. This can typically be done through the app or the service's web portal. Look for settings related to voicemail or notifications, where you should find an option to update your email address. If you're having trouble finding the option, refer to the service's help documentation or customer support for assistance.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">6) What is the cancellation policy?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The cancellation policy for virtual number services varies by provider. Generally, it includes different terms for monthly and annual plans, with some requiring a notice period (like 30 days) before cancellation, during which you might still be charged. Refund policies can also differ; some may offer a pro-rated refund for unused time, while others may not. Cancellation typically involves deactivating your account, which may lead to the loss of associated numbers and data. To understand the specifics, it’s best to check the provider's website or contact their customer support.</p>

    <div class="network-container">
     <div>We work with Hutchison 3 which is one of the largest mobile networks in the UK and a network that is recognised globally by all major telecom operators. This means guaranteed reachability and total peace of mind that you can be reached by anyone around the world by call or SMS 24/7. Not only is it free for you to receive calls and SMS messages on our numbers, but anyone calling or texting you from the UK on your Virtual Mobile number can do so for free using their inclusive bundled
        minutes and texts.</div>
     <div>This is the major differentiating factor that separates us from our competitors. Most other virtual mobile number providers use numbers belonging to smaller, little heard of UK Mobile Networks. This could mean restricted accessibility for receiving calls and texts, especially one-time passcodes. It also means that people trying to call or text you could end up with expensive phone bills as large telecoms operators often charge a surcharge for calls made to UK virtual mobile numbers belonging to smaller unheard-of networks! Most of our competitors will hide this fact and won't tell you which network their numbers are on. We are open about the fact that our numbers are on the 3 networks!</div>
